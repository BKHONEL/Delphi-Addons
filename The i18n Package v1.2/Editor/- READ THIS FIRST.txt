It is unnecessary to compile i18nEditor, because i18nEditor.exe is already in 
the 'Bin' folder.  This binary is compiled  using the 30 day trial version of 
Delphi XE3.

However, if you prefer to build the binary yourself, before opening i18nEditor 
inside Delphi, you must install the Shell Controls package. The Shell Controls 
package is one of the demo packages of Delphi. You can find the Shell Controls
package at the following locations:

    Delphi 2010:
    {PUBLIC DOCUMENTS}\RAD Studio\7.0\Demos\DelphiWin32\VCLWin32\ShellControls

    Delphi XE2:
    {PUBLIC DOCUMENTS}\RAD Studio\10.0\Samples\Delphi\VCL\ShellControls

    Delphi XE3
    {PUBLIC DOCUMENTS}\RAD Studio\10.0\Samples\Delphi\VCL\ShellControls
