Installation is quite easy:

a.Load Delphi
b.Choose "Component" from the menu
c.Then Choose "Install Component"
d.Click "Add" button and browse for the SkinForm.DCU file and install it
e.The component should now be on the component palette under the "Add On" Page


NOTE:
In Delphi 5, if a "line too long" problem occured, please don't mind, 
it's because Delphi 5 try to open the .dcu like a source code, close 
the source form and recompile to bypass or add the DCU file manually 
to a .dpk file.

We prepared the TSkinForm.dpk for using, if your don't like, you can 
add the DCU file to dclusr50.dpk file.

The sample source code is for delphi 5, if you are using Delphi 3 or
Delphi 4, please replace the source files in delphi3&4samples.zip
